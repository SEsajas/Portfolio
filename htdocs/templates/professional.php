            <h4>Which company would you like to work for?</h4>
            <p>
                Respawn Entertainment
            </p>
            <h4>Why there?</h4>
            <p>
                Because I Enjoy gaming and I love the idea of being able to work on a game that others will enjoy just as much as I do then now.
            </p>
            <h4>What does the company stand for?</h4>
            <p>
                Its known for making different types of games
            </p>
            <p>
                Sadly I could'nt contact Respawn Entertainment, so I decited to interview one of the programmers at my work. 
                I work at Teleperformance It is a global company that works with different companys providing them call agents and IT support.
                I've only been here for one month now but im enjoying it alot I love helping people however I can.

            <h4>What does he / she enjoy about work?</h4>

            <p> very broad job challenges, solving problems and re-occurring them, being busy with something else every day</p>

            <h4>What are the duties of a programmer?</h4>

            <p> - ETL development (Extract / Transform / Load. This means that we manage almost all data flows within the company.<br>
                - Web development. We have set up NLAPPS, in which we provide simple tools for operations. In addition, things like HET / PET, GWP, external forms.<br>
                - Piece of management. DEV manages, among other things, Slack, in which we also develop ourselves. See examples like / ticket and / co<br>
                - API development. We build REST APIs ourselves, implement customer solutions with us through APIs. (Quandago, automatic loading of records)<br>
                - Innovation. Things like Fritsie originated within DEV (and SD, creds to Fadi). Also see where you can renew (twilio as a calling platform, sendgrid as a mail provider)
            </p>
            
            <h4>What does it take to become a suitable programmer?</h4>
            <p> - communication.<br>
                - Perseverance. You will have moments when you spend hours on a small piece of code, which just does not work.<br>
                - Deep interest in IT. I think that as a developer it is not bad to sometimes take your work home with you, to benefit yourself (to a limited extent of course)
                - Do your own research. Look at new techniques, and teach yourself these (of course not everything, there is far too many for that nowadays)<br>
                - asking questions and being critical (thinking along). this is especially important within tp, but also outside. If you can keep asking questions<br>
                  and are critical yourself, you often come up with a better tailor-made solution than the customer / end user has requested.
                - be flexible / resistant to stress. Not everything about work is fun. Sometimes you have to swallow and build something that you are not 100% behind.

            <h4>A Software Developer has the following tasks:</h4>
            <p>
                - Writing/testing code.<br>

            <h4>A good Software Developer owns:</h4>
            <p>
                I think a good developer should really own the skill of being able to work together And to be able to communicate.<br> 
                But most importantly being able to take critical advies to grow from that and seeing a different point of view
